NLP clustering could not be performed without further exploration into this specific issue. 
- How you solved it: Pivot towards English only countries UK and USA only data, while saving full dataset for future NLP research project.
- What you learned: A smaller and simplier dataset will be more efficient because data quality is more important than size for accuracy. 
Any dataset, with the use of data engineering facilitates identification and visualization of relationships previously unknown.
